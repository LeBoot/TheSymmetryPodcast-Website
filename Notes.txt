UPLOAD NOTES

	"TheSymmetryPodcast- Version 1" was uploaded without the folder "mp3s", which belongs at 
	TheSymmetryPodcast-Website\TheSymmetryPodcast- Version 1\TheSymmetryPodcast Front-End
		-Be sure to remove this folder before pushing to Git, lest the size of the repo
			increase significantly (and the push take a while).


	"TheSymmetryPodcast- Version 2 Refactored" was uploaded without the folder "mp3", which
	belongs at TheSymmetryPodcast-Website\TheSymmetryPodcast- Version 2 Refactored\bl_TheSymmetryPodcastRefactored\src\main\resources\static
		-Be sure to remove this folder before pushing to Git, lest the .jar file be too
			large for a normal repository.


CONTENT NOTES
	Front-End Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with jQuery), AJAX (with JSON), Bootstrap
	Back-End Technologies: Java, Spring, Tomcat, JPA, Java Mail, Lombok

	1) Security is not Spring Security.  It is hand-done.

	3) Username and passowrd for Java Mail API (found in service layer) have been changed
		since coding this project.
